## Documentation

This is a header-only library, as such most of its functional documentation is contained within the "header section" of the
source code in the form of comments. It is highly recommended that you read said documentation before using this library.

## Features

The lconfig library provides basic config file generation based on a template, its features include:

- No hard dependencies besides the standard library, making it fully portable for most purposes
- Provides int and string config parameters, enough for the most common types of values
- Works even when the OS blocks file access, in which case it will simply use defaults
- Small enough for simple demo programs, powerful enough for full applications
